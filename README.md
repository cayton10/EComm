# EComm CIT410

The following information is the assignment overview for CIT410: E-Commerce.

## General Site Requirements

• Site template/theme (Responsive Theme – borrow one from the web, but it has to be Bootstrap
based)
• Use the provided database PHP Class for all database accesses
• Browse products by category/subcategory
• Filter products on brand, price range, rating (AJAX-based)
• Product listing pagination
• Product Search
• Product Reviews and Ratings
• Product Photo Galleries
• Featured Products
• Quick View and Full View of Products
• Products will support multiple options/colors/sizes, etc.
• Development of a full shopping cart with ability to edit contents
• Development of a mini shopping cart for the site template
• Integration of Authorize.NET payments (will discuss as a class)
• UPS API Integration for calculating and tracking shipments
• AJAX-Based Checkout system (modeled after your favorite E-Commerce site, but I would also
recommend you check out sites such as ToolUp.com, Crutchfield.com, and
TemplateMonster.com for suggestions/examples on what to include including labeling
techniques for form inputs)
• Customer Dashboard to update addresses, view past orders, etc.

## Project 1 

### 6.4.2020
Items needed for each page (php includes):
* Cart
* Customer Dashboard Link (Account Icon)
* Search Bar
* Custom Site Logo
Added all required link placeholders to navigation for header.php and footer.php


### 6.5.2020
Added products to CIT410 database.
Category -> Subcats -> Products and all required fields -> product images.

Created template pages for cart, checkout, single item inspection (shop-single), and browse inventory(shop).
When I say "created" I mean header/footer includes are done and some rudimentary placeholders are added.
